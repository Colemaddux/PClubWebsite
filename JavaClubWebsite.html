<h2>We are an Application Development Club</h3>
  <p>From a basic standpoint, we develop applications using the Java coding language. However, this is not all that we do. We also have different sections of our club that are dedicated to specific tasks correlating to each of our projects. For instance, the Development team writes the actual code and debugs it, etc,. The Marketing team finds ways to advertise the apps that we create so that it reaches a large audience. In conclusion, Java Club is mainly an application development club, but we focus on more than just one aspect of development.</p>
  
<h2>What We Hope to Accomplish</h2>
  <p>The main goals that we hope to accomplish as an application development club are as follows:</p>
  
    <ul>
      
      <li>Gather members that have a genuine interest to develop their skill set and create meaninful programs</li>
      <li>Help each member of our club to learn Java, even if it's only the basic principles</li>
      <li>Develop an application that fulfills a need and is able to be used by any single user. Quality and simplicity are not seperate entities, they are one and the same.</li>
      <li>Gain experience that will benefit each member in whatever career they choose to pursue.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <br>
  
<h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    
    <li>Club Website</li>
    
  </ul>
<!-- This will be more useful once we have projects to work on. Also keeps us up to date and focused on finishing the tasks we set for ourselves. -->

<h2>Computer Club</h2>

<!-- For the Daily Java Fact, I was thinking that I could add a confirm pop up window that says the fact. Or when we end up using bootstrap/wordpress, it'd be easy to have an editable announcement at the top of the page or something. -->
<h3>// Daily Java Fact</h3>
  <p>In the java programming language, the usage of "//" signifies a comment that is disregarded by the compiler. It's used to write personal notes/make code more reusable, and has many other reasons behind it.</p>
  
  <h4>// To Do's</h4>
    <ul>
      
      <li>New name</li>
      <li>Website --- HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Acquire a means of being connected as a group</li>
      <li>Logo, graphic design</li>
      <li>Tell your friends, we need more people</li>
      
    </ul>
    
    
    <h4>// Questions</h4>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Do we want a t-shirt?</li>
        <li>Should we do any fundraising?</li>
        <li>Should we have both groups (for development process) and club representatives (like presidnt, chair members, etc,.) or is the club representatives kinda unnecessary and redundant?</li>
        
      </ul>
      
      
    <h4>// Roles</h4>
      <ol>
        
        <li>For development/coding of the application, we need a programming team leader and then members to make up the team (must know/learn Java)</li>
        <li>For marketing/presentation, we need two roles:</li>
        
        a. Club marketing/presentation through a website (one leader, team members -- maybe break it into personal/smaller group roles?)   b. Application marketing/presentation   i. Includes both website advertisement and application advertisement (monetization -- requires us to be diligent marketers)</li>
        <li>For club events, fundraisers, and meetings, we need a person that can control the money (treasurer), and event organizer, and other club-based positions</li>
        
      </ol>
