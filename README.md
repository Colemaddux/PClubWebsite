# PClubWebsite
A simple Github repository for our clubs website. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
## Goals 
To allow for Coy and I to write and collaborate on the website. 

## How It Works
Coy will upload all his new changes to the master branch, since he is the one fully in charge of the websites development. I will upload any tips/code changes/ideas to a new branch that I'll create, Coy will look at the new uploads via myself, and implement them into the website or talk to me further about the changes suggested by myself.
